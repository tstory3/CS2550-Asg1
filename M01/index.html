            <h2>White Walls</h2>
            <p>My poem is inspired by my day on Saturday.</p>
            <blockquote><i>
                Wake up early morning
                <br>
                White white walls, paint dropping
                <br>
                Paint all the day long
                <br>
            </i>

            <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>I currently work as a Project Manager for Beta Testing at Vivint. This means I work with other project or product managers to implement field testing for their project. It is a pretty new job for me, but have really enjoyed it so far. I would like to stay in a project manager role or move into an engineering role in the future.</p>
            <p>I have a passion for sports. I love playing, watching or learning about sports. I grew up playing sports like baseball, basketball, football and wresting. I have retired from many of these, but enjoy other sports that are a little less damaging on the body like pickleball, softball, spikeball, and tennis.</p>
            <p>I love a challenge and strategy. My wife and I play board games regularly and have around 50 games. We have a range of strategy games like the classic <i>Risk</i> or the more indie based games like <i>Wingspan</i>. We also have games that are more social interaction games like <i>Werewolf</i> or <i>Secret Hitler</i>.</p>
